        <h1>About SqMGR</h1>

        <p>SqMGR is a service for managing your football squares. This site was born out of frustration of having to manage paper-based pools and having to manually keep track of who paid and who didn't.</p>

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Provide easy to maintain squares pools for people who run pools.</li>
            <li>Provide an easy to use interface for people who want to buy a square.</li>
            <li>Make the site free-to-use.</li>
            <li>Make the source code <a href="https://github.com/sqmgr">available</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">open source</a>.</li>
