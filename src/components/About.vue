        <h1>About SqMGR</h1>

        <p>SqMGR is a site for managing your football squares. We built this site because we were tired of managing paper pools. And, other online tools were old, cost money, and/or just poorly maintained.</p>

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Make the site easy for pool administrators</li>
            <li>Make the site even easier for pool participants</li>
            <li>Make the service free. Don't show any ads. Don't sell user data.</li>
            <li>Make the source code available and open source.</li>
        </ul>
