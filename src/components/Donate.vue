        <p>If you like this service, please consider donating to help cover server costs. This ensures I can keep this site up free of charge and without any obnoxious ads. If you're inclined to donate, my Venmo username is <a href="https://venmo.com/?txn=pay&audience=public&recipients=thomaspeters&amount=10&note=SqMGR">thomaspeters</a>.

        <p>The source code for this site is also open-source. So if donating money isn't your thing, perhaps donating some of your brain power is! See <a href="https://github.com/sqmgr/sqmgr">here</a> for the source code.</p>
